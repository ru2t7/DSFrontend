# 🔌 Distributed Systems Frontend: Microservices Client

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It serves as the frontend client for the Dockerized Spring Boot microservices, routing all API calls through the Traefik gateway.

## ⚙️ Key Configuration

This application relies on environment variables set during the build process to correctly access the backend services via Traefik.

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `REACT_APP_PERSON_API_HOST` | `http://localhost/api_person` | Routes requests for the Person/User Service (e.g., Login, User CRUD). |
| `REACT_APP_DEVICE_API_HOST` | `http://localhost/api_device` | Routes requests for the Device Service (e.g., Inventory, Assignment). |

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the **local development mode**.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. This script **requires the backend services (Traefik, Person, Device) to be running via Docker Compose** for API connectivity.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. This is the script run inside the Docker container to generate the final static files served by Nginx.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
